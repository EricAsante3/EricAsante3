I am a Junior at UConn Majoring in Computer Science and Engineering along with a minor in Electronics and Systems. 

I have a strong foundation in Python, C++, SQL, Git, JavaScript, CSS and HTML. 

Through my coursework, I have gained hands-on experience in project-oriented environments, applying Agile software development principles to effectively achieve project goals.

I enjoy exploring new ideas, connecting with people, and staying updated on the latest advancements in technology!

My previous internship role as an Embedded Software Engineer involved me developing software for micro-devices in C and C++ for the purpose of data acquisitions on lithium batteries.

Now I am looking for an internship opportunity where I can challenge and apply my knowledge in a professional setting!
