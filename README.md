I'm a Senior at the University of Connecticut majoring in Computer Science and Engineering, with a minor in Electronics and Systems.

I have a solid background in React.js, web and mobile app development, and hands-on experience with Python, C++, C, Kotlin, AWS, MongoDB, SQL, Git, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and .NET.

My skill set spans both software and hardware, allowing me to design responsive user interfaces, implement backend logic and APIs, and develop embedded systems. I’m passionate about building user-focused solutions and continuously exploring new technologies.

I’m currently seeking full-time engineering opportunities where I can apply my skills in a collaborative and innovative environment.
